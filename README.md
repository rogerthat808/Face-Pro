## Features

- **Face Detection**: Detects faces in images using AI-powered algorithms.
- **Emotion Recognition**: Identifies emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and more.
- **Gender Detection**: Determines the gender of individuals in the images.
- **Age Estimation**: Estimates the age of individuals detected in the images.

## Technologies Used
