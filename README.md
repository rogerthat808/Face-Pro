# Face Detection App

This Face Detection App demonstrates how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be used to detect faces, emotions, gender, and age in images. The app utilizes the face-api.js library, a JavaScript face detection and recognition library created by justadudewhohacks.

## Features

- **Face Detection**: Detects faces in images using AI-powered algorithms.
- **Emotion Recognition**: Identifies emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and more.
- **Gender Detection**: Determines the gender of individuals in the images.
- **Age Estimation**: Estimates the age of individuals detected in the images.

## Technologies Used

- **face-api.js**: A JavaScript library for face detection, recognition, and analysis.
- **HTML/CSS**: Used for the user interface and styling.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the logic and functionality of the app.
